        Regions are areas in the Pokémon universe that are smaller parts of a
        nation. Each region has their own Pokémon Professor, who provides a
        unique set of Starter Pokémon for young Trainers. Each region also has
        a unique set of eight Gym Leaders, along with the regional Elite Four.
        In some cases, regions can share Elite Four divisions, such as Johto
        and Kanto.
      </p>

      <p><u>Each section will be structured as follows:</u></p>

          Kanto was the first region to be introduced in the game series,
          featured in the Red, Blue and Yellow games along with the Generation
          III remakes and the Generation VII remakes. It is also accessible in
          the latter portion of Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal after
          defeating the Elite Four.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most regions, there is a theme regarding the names of towns and
          cities in Kanto. Most locations in Kanto are named after a color.
          The regional Pokémon professor is Professor Oak, who resides in
          Pallet Town.

      <code><b>Fun Fact! </b>The Sevii Islands are a group of islands located
          south of the Kanto region. They are not to be confused with the Orange
          Islands, another island group near Kanto or the Blue Islands near
          Hoenn. The Sevii Islands are accessible in Pokémon FireRed and
          LeafGreen after the player defeats Blaine. They serve the purpose of a
          major side quest involving Bill and is also where the player can catch
          Pokémon from Pokémon Gold and Silver. There are nine islands in all,
          and each of them is accessible once the player does something special.
          The islanders are ferried between the islands by the Seagallop.
